## I followed an Algorithms course where I implement the following algorithms and data structures

### Supported Algorithm

-   Insertion sort
-   Merge sort
-   QuickSort
-   Prim's MST (Adjacency List)
-   Dijkstra's Shortest Path (Adjacency List)

### Supported Data Structures

-   Singly linked list
-   Doubly linked list
-   Queue
-   Stack
-   Graph with Adjacency List
-   Graph with Adjacency Matrix (untested)

### How It Works

1. Have Node & Yarn

2. Clone Repo

3. Install Dependencies

4. Test algorithms with jest

#### Testing

```
yarn test
```
